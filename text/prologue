Ahum! Please, yes! Here The image of the couch please.
Ah yes, thats perfect!

The meaning of life. A question to ask. Indeed! 
You are asking it as you sit on this couch.
[small dramatic pause]
You are asking it as you sit on this couch having done two tabs of acid 
[dramatic pause]
You are asking it as you sit on this couch having done two tabs of acid and you still don't feel anything so you decided to just smoke a joint
[text clears, couch stays]




Now would anyone be asking a question such a question on such a night like this?
I wonder that myself too.

It is as mysterious as the very question you ponder about right now...

(press p to ponder)
[clear text]
It is as mysterious as the very question to ponder on why it is that we ponder.
Could we not take life for granted? Embrace it as it is?
(small pause)
You sit and think for a while, for a moment you don't even think at all

For a brief moment you are disconnected from the world, immersed in ones own head,
time is no longer relative but personal. No frame of reference is created so you sit, endlessy, in the moment

(medium pause)
kind of like playing a video game.
Wait.
